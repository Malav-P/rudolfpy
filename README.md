# python-filter
Generic filter implementations in python, named after Rufolf E. Kálmán himself. 

Note: [`FilterPy`](https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a "pedalogical" tool, and may compromise on performance. In contrast, the filters in this repository are meant to be performant "enough" for the purpose of doing research.
